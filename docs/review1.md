## Review Questions

1. **Vibe Coding & AI in Practice**  
   a. Define *vibe coding* and *vibe maintenance*.  
   b. Evaluate whether vibe coding encourages or undermines long-term software  
      engineering quality. Support your position with one concrete argument.  

2. **AI and Productivity**  
   a. Define *innovator’s dilemma* and *startup evaluations*.  
   b. Analyze a modern AI startup: how might prioritizing rapid prototyping harm  
      its long-term sustainability? Give one concrete example.  

3. **Classical Software Engineering Process**  
   a. Define the *V-Model* and *Fred Brooks’ ratios* (planning, coding, testing).  
   b. Critique LLM-first “build immediately” approaches using the V-Model lens.  
      Where do they risk failure, and how could they be adapted to mitigate  
      those risks?  

4. **Hype Cycles & Bubbles**  
   a. Define *trough of disillusionment* and *plateau of productivity*.  
   b. Compare today’s AI boom to one past bubble (dot-com, object-oriented, etc.).  
      What parallels do you see, and what key differences might make this cycle  
      play out differently?  

5. **Software Supply Chain Risks**  
   a. Define the *left-pad incident* and a *supply chain attack*.  
   b. Propose one strategy to reduce dependency risk in modern software  
      ecosystems, and explain how it would have changed the outcome in one of  
      the cases discussed (NPM or Hezbollah pager).
