  - Ask two LLMs to find what is missing in your 1a1 deliverables.  
    - Default focus: ChatGPT and Claude  
    - Other options: Gemini Pro, DeepSeek, LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon, etc.  
    - ⚠️ Note: Some cost $$$, which may limit the number of queries.  
  - Be aware of **context window issues** (Claude’s is smaller than ChatGPT’s).  
  - For each LLM:  
    - First, offer prompts training them in what is a *use case* (see below).  
    - Work from a directory containing the relevant docs you downloaded.  
    - Compare results from **zero-shot prompting** vs **careful prompting**.  

**What to hand in**:  
  - Reflection document (max half page): differences you see in the LLM reports.  
  - Report the **total cost of LLM usage** (note: up to $80 is acceptable,  
    divided 4 ways between 4 team members = $25 each).
