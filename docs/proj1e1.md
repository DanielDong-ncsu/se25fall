# Design Proj2

Write a management-level pamphlet describing your project. For samples, see https://github.com/Kii4ka/CSC510_Software_Engineering_Posters_Spring2025/discussions.

Submit as a pdf to your repo in a directory proj1e.

For examples of these posters, see [here](https://github.com/Kii4ka/CSC510_Software_Engineering_Posters_Spring2025/discussions). 

> Note that for Proj1 you will NOT have  have test cases nor  QR codes that link to  example videos or a repo
  
Each pamphlet must satisfy the checklist below. Each pamphlet:

1. [ ] Be exciting
2. [ ] Not be silly (so exciting, but professional)
3. [ ] Have a clear mission statement paragraph. The **why** (the chalelnge you arerepsonding too) and the **what** (you will build) and the **so what* (benefits of this sstem)
    - e.g. "Online content can be emotionally overwhelming our app helps make sense of it. Sentiment Analyzer Pro lets users analyze the emotional tone of text, images, news, speech, and even YouTube comments. Whether you're tracking brand sentiment, filtering negativity, or just staying informed, the app makes emotional insights fast and accessible. With a Chrome extension and improved Ul, it's now easier than ever to understand how content feels not just what it says."
4. [ ] List the  stakeholders (e.g Admin, Staff,   Customer.    Who else?). Maybe as part of the mission statement?
5.  [ ] Include at  least 8 milestones  cases (4 for October, a further 4 planned for "release2" in Novermber).
    - Be ambitious. Dull milestones will lose you marks in Proj2
    - Not be too ambitious (hey, be ware, you have to code this).
6. [ ] Include a screen snaps of the proposed system (if you are some cli thing, then this will be simple: just a snap of some proposed call to some tool, with  with some text printed out 
7. [ ] Be a **standard page size** (e.g., letter or A4).
8. [ ] Use **small fonts** (text may be as small as 4 to 6 points).
9. [ ] Be submitted as a **PDF file**.
10. [ ] Avoid vast amounts of **white space**.
11. [ ] Show a group number
12. [ ] Show group member names
13. [ ] Show icons describing your proposed tech stack e.g.

<img width="472" height="72" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a6e49b2-645d-4209-833b-31e7856902e9" />
