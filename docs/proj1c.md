# Project 1c1  

**Due**: Monday, Sept 15  
**What**: Problem condensation  

**What to do**:  
  - Time to get serious, and minimal.  
  - LLMs give you many choices. Which will you use?  
  - Your goal is a **MVP (minimal viable product)**: the most basic version of a product that allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least amount of effort.  
  - Decide what from **1b1 you will NOT be doing**, and justify why you will not be doing that.  
  - For this task, keep showing the two LLMs the current use cases and ask them for answers to parts 2, 3 (shown at right).  
  - Generate **at least 10 new use cases** (5 pages total) describing the new design, each with:  
    - Preconditions  
    - Main Flow  
    - Subflows  
    - Alternative Flows  

**What to hand in**:  
  - The new use cases (â‰¥10, 5 pages total)  
  - Reflection document (max 1 page):  
    - What negative impacts or disappointments this MVP could have for your stakeholders.  
    - What changes you made (and why) to the MVP to appease at least some of the stakeholders.
